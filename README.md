# Hello.

I will format this in a FAQ format, purely for simplicity's sake.
Please take a look below and read common questions that I've been asked:

---

### Who am I?

I'm currently a student at **St. Clair College**, a post-secondary instutition located in Windsor, Ontario.
I started coding around 2015 when I was introduced to Python in high school (yawn). 
Didn't get too serious, until I enrolled in the above-mentioned college in 2018 'till I flunked out, and went at it again in 2019 because I'm not a quitter.
I've also dabbled a bit in cyber-security, though I find it to be tedious and I'm putting that on hold because I'd rather have my priorities straight.

### Which kind of platform do I commonly do developing work on?

I've done and still can do the following:

- Desktop
- Web
- Mobile (both Android and iOS)

I want to get into spatial computing and 3D volumetric technology, as they seem to be pretty cool and could probably be brought into the mainstream platform.

I've worked on the following: 

- A [mobile app designed to fit onto the screen of a LiDAR robot](https://github.com/huzeir2k/temi-interview-app) with my friend [Dylan](https://github.com/dylanshawol) during COVID-19,

- A few projects for Enactus St. Clair such as [InterACT](https://www.enactusstclair.ca/projects), an entrepreneurial organization that has a chapter in the above-mentioned college that I'm a member of.
